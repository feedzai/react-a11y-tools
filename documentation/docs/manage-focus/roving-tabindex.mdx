:::note How to

- Use the tab key to navigate to the Menu.
- Then, use the `ArrowUp` and `ArrowDown` keys to go through each option.
- Try pressing `Home` or `End` to jump right to the first or last elements on the group.
- Press `tab` (or `shift+tab`) again to exit.

### Development Instructions

#### 1. Wrap each roving tabindex group in a `RoverProvider`

You can nest roving tabindex components in other DOM elements or React components.

```jsx
import { RoverProvider } from "@feedzai/react-a11y-tools";
...
<RoverProvider>
	{..content here}
</RoverProvider>
```

You can also choose the direction of the navigation.
It can either be "vertical" (default) or "horizontal".

```jsx
import { RoverProvider } from "@feedzai/react-a11y-tools";
...
<RoverProvider direction="horizontal">
	{..content here}
</RoverProvider>
```

Choosing between "vertical" and "horizontal" implies you can use:

- `horizontal` - "ArrowLeft" and "ArrowRight" keys
- `vertical` - "ArrowUp" and "ArrowDown"
- `Home` key to go to the first element
- `End` key to go to the last element

#### 2. Wrap each focusable element

For composition, try to identify which elements are the ones that are going to be affected by the `RoverProvider`.
For each one of those, wrap them with your own component and use the `useRover` and `useFocus` hooks.

```jsx
import { useRover, useFocus } from "@feedzai/react-a11y-tools";
...
const MenuButton = ({ disabled = false, children }) => {
	const buttonRef = useRef(null);

	const [tabIndex, focused, handleKeyDown, handleClick] = useRover(buttonRef, disabled);

	useFocus(focused, buttonRef);

	function onKeyDown(event) {
		handleKeyDown(event);
		yourOwnFunctionToDoWhatever(event);
	}

	function onClick(event) {
		handleClick(event);
		yourOwnFunctionToDoWhatever(event);
	}

	return (
		<button
			ref={ref}
			type="button"
			tabIndex={tabIndex}
			disabled={disabled}
			onKeyDown={handleKeyDown}
			onClick={onClick}
		>
			{children}
		</button>
	);
};
```

#### 3. Place them inside your `RoverProvider` structure

Since `RovingTabIndex` relies on React Context, there's no need to have the buttons all as direct children of the provider.
You can nest as deep as you'd like and it will work as well ðŸ™‚

```jsx
import { RoverProvider } from "@feedzai/react-a11y-tools";
...
<RoverProvider direction="horizontal">
	<MenuButton>First Button</MenuButton>
	<MenuButton disabled>Second Button</MenuButton>
	<ul>
		<li><MenuButton>Another Button</MenuButton>
		<li><MenuButton>Another Button</MenuButton>
		<li><MenuButton>Another Button</MenuButton>
		<li><MenuButton>Another Button</MenuButton>
	</ul>
</RoverProvider>
```

### Extra Features

#### 1. Disable the "loop around" feature

By default, if you try to tab past the very start or very end of the roving tabindex then tabbing does not wrap around. The `RoverProvider` has an optional `loopAround` property on the options prop that allows you to change this:

```jsx
import { RoverProvider } from "@feedzai/react-a11y-tools";
...
<RoverProvider direction="horizontal">
...
</RoverProvider>
```

If this option is set to `true` then tabbing will wrap around if you reach the very start or very end of the roving tabindex items, rather than stopping. Note that this option does not apply if the roving tabindex is being used with a grid.

#### 2. Disable the "focus on click" feature

By default, clicking on a roving tabindex item will result in `focus()` being invoked on the item (via `useFocus`).
So, if you want to when you invoke `focus()` ONLY when you use the keyboard to move to an item, then the `RoverProvider` has an optional `focusOnClick` property on the `options` prop that allows you to change this:

```jsx
import { RoverProvider } from "@feedzai/react-a11y-tools";
...
<RoverProvider options={{
	focusOnClick: false, // default is true
	direction: "horizontal"
}}>
...
</RoverProvider>
```

### Grid Usage

This package supports a roving tabindex in a grid. For each usage of the `useRover` hook in the grid, you must pass a row index value as a property in the second argument to the hook:

```jsx
import { useRover } from "@feedzai/react-a11y-tools";
...
const [tabIndex, focused, handleKeyDown, handleClick] = useRover(
  ref,
  {
	disabled,
	rowIndex: yourRowIndexValueHere
  },
);
```

The row index value must be the zero-based row index for the grid item that the hook is being used with. Thus all items that represent the first row of grid items should have passed to the hook, the second row 1, and so on. If the shape of the grid can change dynamically then it is fine to update the row index value. For example, the grid might initially have four items per row but get updated to have three items per row.

The `direction` property of the `RoverProvider` is ignored when row indexes are provided. This is because the ArrowUp and ArrowDown keys are always used to move between rows.

### Differences with `Focus Manager`

Both are made to deal with focus and navigation but do it in different ways and for different scenarios:

1. The `FocusManager` can, if necessary, scope the focus inside a group and allows the user to press the `tab` key to move to the next "tabbable" element (or `shift+tab` to move to the previous).

   ðŸ’¡ Tip: Use it for dealing with interface elements that require focus control, like popovers, modals and side menus.

<br />

2. The `RoverProvider` can also manage focus inside a group but, instead of using the `tab` key to move
   back and forth between elements, it uses navigation keys (`ArrowUp`, `ArrowDown`, `ArrowLeft` or `ArrowRight`)
   to do that.

   It also makes the other group's elements unable to receive focus using the `tab` key since it applies the negative `tabindex` to the components that are not currently selected.

   ðŸ’¡ Tip: Use it for dealing with interface elements that require selection, like a custom select element or a navigation menu. (Still, you should try to use the native HTML elements).
