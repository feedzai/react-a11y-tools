import { MessagesAnnouncer } from "../../../src/index";
import { Subtitle, BrowserWindow } from "../../src/components";
import { DemoMessagesAnnouncer } from "./demos";

<Subtitle>Announce content changes.</Subtitle>

It is common on single-page web apps that assistive technologies completely ignore significant changes happening inside a page, mainly because we manipulate the DOM with JavasScript.

Like the `RouteAnnouncer`, with the `MessagesAnnoucer`, we create an ARIA live region that the assistive technologies will monitor. So, any changes that you push to this component, a screen-reader will announce them.

<BrowserWindow>
	<DemoMessagesAnnouncer />
</BrowserWindow>
<br />

:::note How to

- Start your screen-reader (like `VoiceOver` or `Narrator`)
- Focus on the "Pay" button.
- Notice that a message will be displayed.
- However, the screen-reader will output a different and more meaningful message.

### Usage

You can use component to wrap the contents of a form, for instance.
This renders the form and, alongside it, the ARIA live region.

```jsx
import { MessagesAnnouncer } from "@jtmdias/react-a11y-tools/";
...
return (
	<MessagesAnnouncer>
		<form onSubmit={handleOnSubmit}>
			...
		</form>
	</MessagesAnnouncer>
);
```

### useMessageAnnouncer

To dispatch messages inside a functional component, you can take advantage of the `useMessageAnnouncer` custom hook.

First, import the hook at the top of the file:

```jsx
import { useMessageAnnouncer } from "@jtmdias/react-a11y-tools/";
```

Then, after you've defined your component, save the hook to a constant:

```jsx
function YourComponent(props) {
	const setMessage = useMessageAnnouncer();
```

Finally, use the function whenever you'd like to announce something.

```jsx
function onClick() {
	setMessage({
		message: "The user has performed an action that it will be announced!",
		politeness: "assertive",
	});
}

return (
	<button type="button" onClick={onClick}>
		Send Message
	</button>
);
```

### Global State

The component takes advantage of React's `Context` API to use the updater function anywhere inside the `MessagesAnnouncer` children.
To have the announcer available for the whole app, consider wrapping the content with it. This way, you can access the `setMessage` function from any component inside.

```jsx
import { MessagesAnnouncer } from "@jtmdias/react-a11y-tools/";
...
return (
	<MessagesAnnouncer>
		<YourComponent />
	</MessagesAnnouncer>
);
```

### Working alongside Route Announcer

You can use the `MessageAnnouncer` along with the `RouteAnnouncer`.
However, we recommend that you still place the `RouteAnnouncer` at the top and then inside it, the `MessagesAnnouncer`.

```jsx
import { MessagesAnnouncer } from "@jtmdias/react-a11y-tools/";
...
return (
	<RouteAnnouncer pathname={pathname}>
		<MessagesAnnouncer>
			<YourComponent />
		</MessagesAnnouncer>
	</RouteAnnouncer>
);
```
