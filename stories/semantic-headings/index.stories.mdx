## How to operate this demo

- Press the `tab` key
- A skip link will be shown on the top of the demo.
- Press `enter`
- Focus will be set on the area of that `SkipLink`.

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Semantic Headings">{() => <HeadingsDemo />}</Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Semantic Headings" />

We can even preview multiple Stories in a block. This
gets rendered as a group, but defines individual stories
with unique URLs which is great for review and testing.
