 * This will inject the `axe-core` runtime into the page under test. You must run this after a call to ` cy.visit()` and before you run the `checkA11y` command.
 * You can run this command with `cy.injectAxe()` either in your test, or in a `beforeEach`, as long as the visit comes first
 *
 * @example
 *
 * beforeEach(() => {
 *  cy.visit('http://localhost:9000');
 *  cy.injectAxe();
